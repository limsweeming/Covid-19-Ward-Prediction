#### Background

The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic on March 11, while the exponential increase in the number of cases was risking to overwhelm health systems around the world with a demand for ICU beds far above the existing capacity, with regions of Italy being prominent examples.

Brazil recorded the first case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 26, and the virus transmission evolved from imported cases only, to local and finally community transmission very rapidly, with the federal government declaring nationwide community transmission on March 20.

Until March 27, the state of São Paulo had recorded 1,223 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 68 related deaths, while the county of São Paulo, with a population of approximately 12 million people and where Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein is located, had 477 confirmed cases and 30 associated death, as of March 23. Both the state and the county of São Paulo decided to establish quarantine and social distancing measures, that will be enforced at least until early April, in an effort to slow the virus spread.

One of the motivations for this challenge is the fact that in the context of an overwhelmed health system with the possible limitation to perform tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, testing every case would be impractical and tests results could be delayed even if only a target subpopulation would be tested.

##### Dataset

This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at São Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.

#### Task

Predict admission to general ward, semi-intensive unit or intensive care unit among confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected among confirmed COVID-19 cases during a visit to the emergency room, would it be possible to predict which patients will need to be admitted to a general ward, semi-intensive unit or intensive care unit?
